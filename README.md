# autoamted-call-transcription-live-dashboard
This project manages call logs, their associated files, transcribes them and pushes them into a pipeline for sentiment analysis, summarization, caller identification, call tagging and agent analysis, where all the data is logged in the backend and can be seen on a Looker Dashboard updating live.
